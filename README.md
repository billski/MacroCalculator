# MacroCalculator
Simple Macro Calculator 
by Billski<br>
Calculates the total daily calorie needs based on the Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and exercise calories burned. This total represents the amount of energy a person needs to maintain their current weight, considering their daily activity level. However, it does not adjust for specific goals like fat loss, maintenance, or muscle gain.

To tailor the calorie calculation for specific goals:

<b>Fat Loss:</b> Typically, you would create a caloric deficit, meaning consuming fewer calories than the total daily calorie needs. A common approach is to reduce the total daily calories by a certain percentage (e.g., a 10-20% reduction from the maintenance calories).

<b>Maintenance:</b> For maintenance, you would use the calculated total daily calories without any adjustments. This aims to keep the body weight stable.

<b>Muscle Building:</b> For muscle gain, a caloric surplus is usually needed. This means consuming more calories than the body burns. A common approach is to increase the total daily calories by a certain percentage (e.g., an additional 10-20% on top of maintenance calories).

In the script, the macro breakdown is a basic example (15% protein, 55% carbs, 30% fats). These percentages can be adjusted based on individual dietary needs and specific goals. For instance, muscle building often requires higher protein intake, while fat loss might focus on a balanced reduction across all macros with a higher protein intake to preserve muscle mass.

For a more tailored approach, especially for specific fitness goals, dietary preferences, or medical needs, it is advisable to consult with a nutritionist or a healthcare professional. They can provide personalized advice based on individual health profiles and fitness goals.
